          content: "Interning at Chicago Agent Magazine taught me a lot about the print process and allowed me to write about diverse issues such as the current uncertainty regarding Hispanic homeownership rates during COVID-19. Writing this article was really eye-opening in regards to how communities are being impacted by the current pandemic. I conducted several interviews with significant Hispanic realtors about the current situation and how they predict Hispanic homeowners will recover. This not only helped strengthen my news-writing but also allowed me to report on important current events.",
